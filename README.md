Dvorak - Programmer's
=================

Currently only Polish (ISO) version for Mac is available, but I'll gladly accept any PR.

## Installation

### ï£¿ Mac

From repo root execute:

```bash
# To make this layout available to ALL USERS:
sudo cp -R mac/Dvorak\ -\ Programmer\'s.bundle /Library/Keyboard Layouts

# To current user only
cp -R mac/Dvorak\ -\ Programmer\'s.bundle ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts
```

After that log out & log in again.
