Dvorak - Programmer's
=====================

Currently only Polish (ISO) version for Mac is available, but I'll gladly accept any PR.

Click [here](https://github.com/chester1000/dvorak-programmer/blob/master/mac/Dvorak%20-%20Programmer's%20(Polish,%20ISO).pdf?raw=true) to see layout.

## Installation

### ï£¿ Mac

From repo root execute:

```bash
# To make this layout available to ALL USERS:
sudo cp -R mac/Dvorak\ -\ Programmer\'s.bundle /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts

# To current user only
cp -R mac/Dvorak\ -\ Programmer\'s.bundle ~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts
```

After that log out & log in again.
